/// @ingroup costfunctions
/// <summary>An implementation of the collision-avoidance force proposed by Helbing and Molnar,
/// in the paper "Social force model for pedestrian dynamics" (1995).</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This paper defines a force per neighboring agent, and thus the implementation inherits from ObjectInteractionForces.
///
/// ### Notes:
/// <list>
/// <item>This version of the SFM contains one important difference to the 1995 paper: the avoidance force F_ij uses the 
/// *relative velocity* of agents i and j, and not the *absolute velocity* of j. This correction occurs in later SFM papers as well.</item>
/// <item>This cost function does *not* include a goal-reaching component. 
/// Thus, to bring agents to their goals, you need to combine this cost function with (for example) GoalReachingForce.</item>
/// <item>The <tt>%SocialForces.xml</tt> policy in our example files reproduces the original algorithm, 
/// using two cost functions: SocialForces and GoalReachingForce.</item>
///
/// ### Name in XML files:
/// <tt>%SocialForcesAvoidance</tt>
/// 
/// ### Parameters:
/// <list>
/// <item>dt (float): A time window parameter used in force calculations. 
/// Could be interpreted as the lookahead time for estimating the future positions of agents.</item>
/// <item>V0 (float): A scaling factor for all agent-avoidance forces.</item>
/// <item>sigma (float): Determines the steepness of the exponential function defining an agent-avoidance force.
/// Could be interpreted as the distance (in meters) that an agent wants to keep from another agent.</item>
/// <item>U0 (float): A scaling factor for all obstacle-avoidance forces.</item>
/// <item>R (float): Determines the steepness of the exponential function defining an obstacle-avoidance force. 
/// Could be interpreted as the distance (in meters) that an agent wants to keep from obstacles.</item>
/// </list>
