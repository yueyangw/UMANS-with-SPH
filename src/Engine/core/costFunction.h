/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>const static std::string GetName(): This method should return the name that identifies the function in configuration files.</item>
/// <item>GetCost(): This method should compute and return the cost of a velocity according to your cost function.</item>

/// Make sure to call the parent version of parseParameters() here, to parse any parameters that were already defined.</item>
